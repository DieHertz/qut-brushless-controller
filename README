Description:
============

This project was started as an undergraduate research project. It is
currently being extended and open-sourced. Basic concepts and design
should be adaptable to almost any sized controller and motor.


Goals:
======

* Brushless speed controller in it's simplest form, with various
  expansion possibilities.
* Elegant, easy to comprehend code.
* Reliable, adaptable startup routine.
* Reliable zero crossing detection.
* Efficient commutation timing.
* Stall detection.
* Various input formats: RC Servo Signal, TWI (I2C), and UART.
* Debugging: use an LED as a visual flag, or send data through serial.


Status:
